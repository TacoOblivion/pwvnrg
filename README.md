### How to install/use with Asterelle's PWE Vanilla Enhance? (Recommended)
1. Follow the installation instructions at https://github.com/asterpw/pwevanillaenhance
2. There will be a small blue cogwheel in your user control bar. Click on that.
3. Under themes you will find the themes from here. Click on one to load it.
4. It is recommended that you reload the page after setting all of the theme pieces you want so that they load in the correct order.

### How to install/use with Stylish? (Manual)
1. Get the addon called "Stylish" for Firefox or Chrome.
2. Go to http://perfectworld.vanillaforums.com/
3. Create a new style by clicking on the link pointed to on this picture. ![Example](http://dump.nrgs.org/pwpw/StylishPWEFStyles2.png)
4. Copy the data from the CSS file by clicking on a ".css" file provided above and paste it into the editor.
5. Give the style a title/name and click the save button.
6. Repeat steps 3-6 until you have everything you need.
7. Click on the checkmarks to activate each style. Some are ordered. The order can be viewed below.
8. You can now use http://www.arcgames.com/en/forums to view the forums and the styles will stay. You won't be able to activate/deactivate unless on http://perfectworld.vanillaforums.com/

### Should always be activated (even if you activate nothing else)
0. Global Fixes

### Proper Activation Order
Pick a style, then follow each list indent to activate a theme to look as it was designed.

Example: To activate Pro Blue. Activate 'Grayscale'. Then activate 'Pro Blue'.
Example 2: To activate VA Eclipse. Activate 'Grayscale'. Then activate 'Colorful Addon'. Lastly activate 'VA Eclipse'.

For proper looks, addons are optional unless the theme is listed under it, like 'VA Eclipse' and 'The Blues'. If using
addons that are not considered to be needed for proper look, ensure you activate it at the level of activation before
activating the rest of the indented list.

Example: To have VA Eclipse with Compact Addon. Activate 'Grayscale' -> Activate 'Colorful Addon' -> Activate 'Compact Addon' -> Activate 'VA Eclipse'

### What JS?
None yet. I've been actively trying to avoid using JS. I want to do as much as I can in pure CSS.

### For programmers / extension makers
You can gather meta information about the themes from files.json. More on this to come later...
